# Pruning-the-Neural-Networks

# **Purning**
Pruning is one of the methods for inference to efficiently produce models smaller in size, more memory-efficient, more power-efficient and faster at inference with minimal loss in accuracy, other such techniques being weight sharing and quantization. Out of several aspects that deep learning takes as an inspiration from the area of Neuroscience. Pruning in deep learning is also a biologically inspired.

## Purning helps to solve the problems of:
1) Model are getting larger<br>
2) Speed of the machine if you use CPU<br>
3) Energy Efficiency (Memory Usage)
